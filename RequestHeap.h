* Description : Header file for the Request Heap class. Request heap is the class of array based implementation of heap data
 * structure for request objects. It's a maxheap as the heap rebuilds according to the biggest priority of the request, however when there are multiple biggest priorities, the maximum heap element will
 * be the one that has the smallest request time, and when there are multiple smallest request times, then the maximum element will be the one has the smallest id.
